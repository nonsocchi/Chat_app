## Chat App
A simple chat app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The chat app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), specifically Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to:
- equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and
- secure authentication methods.

This is a modern messaging app where users can sign up (register) and login to chat.
